      "\n",
      "4. Since the new state [3,-1] violates the rule of not moving outside the grid (the y-coordinate is -1, which is less than 0), this action is not valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. However, the question of whether the action is \"good\" or \"bad\" in the context of the cliff walking problem is different. In this context, moving up from the starting position [3,0] is considered \"bad\" because it would lead to an invalid state that would result in the player being returned to the start due to the cliff.\n",

      "2. The action is to move right. According to the rules, moving right means increasing the Y-coordinate by 1.\n",
      "3. Since the current Y-coordinate is 0, moving right would make it 1. However, the goal is at [3, 11], which is in the positive Y-direction, and moving right is not directly towards the goal.\n",
      "4. Also, we need to check if the player will fall off the cliff. The cliff is at locations [3, 1..10]. Since the player's current location is [2,0] and the action is to move right, the new location would be [2,1], which is not on the cliff.\n",

      "- **Progress Towards the Goal**: Moving right does not directly help in reaching the goal located at [3,11] because it doesn't change the x-coordinate (which needs to be 3 to reach the goal) and only incrementally increases the y-coordinate, which is still far from the goal's y-coordinate (11).\n",
